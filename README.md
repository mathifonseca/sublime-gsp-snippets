# Sublime Text GSP Snippets

##Installation
The easiest way to get these snippets, is by using [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/). If you already have it, you just need to search **GSP Snippets** and install it. In case you don't, take a look [here](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).

##Usage
Once you have installed the snippets, the only thing you need to do is type the desired trigger and hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> (or whatever you have set as completion key). Also, you can press <kbd>âŒ˜ + Space</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl + Space</kbd>) to get a list of all available completions.

##Triggers
It's the sequence of keys you have will press to insert a snippet. For your (and our) convenience, all our snippets start with the letter ***g***, so that you can start from there and choose from the options that the autocomplete prompts you.

##Fields
As you probably already know, there are tags that have optional attributes and many other variations. We've created these snippets according to our usual needs and as you press <kbd>Tab</kbd>, you will navigate the fields you need to fill. But in some cases, we've added more attributes that will be highlighted so that you can press <kbd>Delete</kbd> if you don't need them or <kbd>Tab</kbd> again if you do.

##Collaboration
We created these snippets because we got tired of copy/pasting from the [Grails Guide](http://grails.org/doc/latest/), so most of them are just shortcuts to the default tags that are presented there. In some cases, you will find our own inventions, like the **gfor**, which is a ``<g:each>`` tag with a range.

So if you think we got something wrong, have any suggestions, want to make a request or add some creation of your own, please feel free to contact us.
